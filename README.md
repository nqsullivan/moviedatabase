# Cross Platform Movie Database 
## Overview
### 1. Give a brief overview of what your project idea is
A movie database that allows users to find movies they want to watch, across all the streaming services. Users will
search for a movie by keyword, and the app will return a list of movies that match the keyword. The user can then
select a movie to see which streaming services it is available on. The user can also select a streaming service to
see which movies are available on that service. The app will also allow users to create an account and save movies
to their watchlist.

### 2. What does the application do?
The application will allow admin users to CRUD movies. It will allow regular users to search for movies and add them to
their watchlist. The application will also track how often a movie is searched for and how often it is added to a
watchlist. This information will be used to determine a suggested list of movies for users to watch.

### 3. What data will be stored?
The application will store movies, users, and watchlists. The movies will be stored with the movie title, movie
description, number of times accessed, a rotten tomatoes or IMDB rating, and a list of streaming services that the movie
is available on. The users will be stored with a username, password, permission set, and a list of movies that they have
added to their watchlist. The watchlists will be stored as a list of movies and will be identified by its owner, the
user.
